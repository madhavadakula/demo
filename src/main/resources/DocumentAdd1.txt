## Java Code Documentation: `com.example.demo.Math`

This document describes the `Math` class located in the `com.example.demo` package.  The class provides a single method for adding two integers.

**Package:** `com.example.demo`

**Class:** `Math`

**Purpose:** This class provides a simple addition operation for two integer inputs.  While it shares a name with the standard Java `java.lang.Math` class, it is a distinct and separate class with limited functionality.  It's likely intended for educational or illustrative purposes, rather than production use.  Consider renaming this class to avoid confusion with the standard library.

**Method:**

* **`public int add(int a, int b)`**

    * **Description:** This method takes two integer arguments (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum as an integer.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `a`: An integer.
        * `b`: An integer.
    * **Return Value:** An integer representing the sum of `a` and `b`.
    * **Exceptions:** This method does not throw any exceptions.


**Example Usage:**

```java
import com.example.demo.Math;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Math math = new Math();
        int sum = math.add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum); // Output: The sum is: 8
    }
}
```

**Considerations:**

* **Naming:** The class name `Math` is strongly discouraged due to the naming conflict with the standard Java `java.lang.Math` class.  A more descriptive and unique name, such as `SimpleMath` or `IntegerAdder`, is recommended.
* **Error Handling:**  The class lacks error handling. For a more robust solution, consider adding checks for potential integer overflow.
* **Functionality:** The class only provides a single, basic operation.  For a more practical class, additional mathematical functions could be added.


This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `Math` class's functionality and usage.  However,  improving the class name and potentially adding more features would make it a more useful and less ambiguous component.
