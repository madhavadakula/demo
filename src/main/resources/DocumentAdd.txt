## Java Code Documentation: `com.example.demo.Math`

This document describes the `Math` class located in the `com.example.demo` package.  This class provides a simple method for adding two integers.

**Package:** `com.example.demo`

**Class:** `Math`

**Purpose:**  This class demonstrates a basic mathematical operation: addition of two integers.  While a similar functionality is already provided by Java's built-in `Math` class, this example serves as a simple illustration of creating and using a custom class.

**Methods:**

* **`public int add(int a, int b)`:**
    * **Description:** This method takes two integer arguments (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum as an integer.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `a`: An integer representing the first addend.
        * `b`: An integer representing the second addend.
    * **Return Value:** An integer representing the sum of `a` and `b`.
    * **Example:**
        ```java
        Math math = new Math();
        int sum = math.add(5, 3); // sum will be 8
        ```


**Limitations:**

* The current implementation only handles integer addition.  It does not include error handling for potential overflow issues.
*  The class name clashes with the standard Java `Math` class.  For production code, a more descriptive class name should be used (e.g., `IntegerAdder`).


**Potential Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Add error handling (e.g., using exceptions) to manage potential integer overflow situations.
* **Data Type Flexibility:** Modify the method to accept other numeric data types (e.g., `long`, `double`, `float`).
* **More Operations:** Extend the class to include other mathematical operations (subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).
* **Naming:** Rename the class to avoid conflict with the standard `java.lang.Math` class.


This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `Math` class's functionality and limitations. It also suggests potential improvements for future development.
